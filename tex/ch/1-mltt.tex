\chapter{Martin-L\"of Type Theory}


We start the theoretical part of this work focusing on Martin-L\"of's take
on intuitionistic logic and type theory. Before we do that, however, a quick
note on the historical evolution of the subject. For brevity, we will
use the abbreviation MLTT for Martin-L\"of's Type Theory.

\section{Brief Historical Overview}

Type theory was first developed by Bertrand Russell and some of his
collaborators and then expanded by Frank Ramsey and others. It was used
first to introduce a kind of hierarchy of (mathematical) concepts
that would \qq{solve} Russell's paradox. At the same time, in the first
part of the twentieth century, the Dutch mathematician L.\ E.\ J.\ Brouwer,
then continuing with the American mathematician E.\ Bishop sowed the seeds
of \emph{constructive mathematics}. They put the emphasis on proofs that
actually produce examples of the concepts existential quantifiers speak of.
Thus, for example, any proof of a proposition of the form $ \exists x $ such
that $ P $ must contain a method of actually instantiating that $ x $.
This approach contrasted with the formalism developed by leading mathematicians
such as D.\ Hilbert who proposed that mathematics should be performed
simply following abstract rules and that showing a method to obtain an $ x $
in the previous example does not necessarily mean that that $ x $ should be
obtained \qq{practically}, but only \emph{in principle}.

At the same time, philosopher and logician A.\ Heyting summarized in his
monograph \cite{heyting} the approach that became known as
\emph{intuitionistic logic}. This emphasized constructive proofs as well
and was used by Brouwer as a formal basis for his mathematical program.

In the second half of the twentieth century, the Swedish mathematician and philosopher
Per Martin-L\"of exposed his take on intuitionistic logic and type theory
into what became known as \emph{Martin-L\"of type theory}. This approach
draws influences from the philosophical work of F.\ Brentano, G.\ Frege and
E.\ Husserl, but also uses the \emph{Curry-Howard correspondence} between
propositions and programs, terms and proofs (excellently detailed in \cite{ch}).

Martin-L\"of's approach became extremely influential and with the help of
works such as \cite{pmltt}, it was quickly implemented as a foundation for
extremely powerful proof assistants such as NuPRL, Coq, Agda, Idris and others.

It is also worth mentioning that type theory and intuitionistic logic have
continued to develop independently from applications in computer science.
As such, types and toposes are seen as good candidates to provide
\qq{proper} foundations of mathematics instead of sets. Some very important
contributions have come from the HoTT group (\cite{hott}).

We will not go into more historical or philosophical details of this subject
and instead further focus on the mathematical aspects that were then
implemented in proof assistants.

\section{Fundamentals of MLTT}

MLTT draws inspiration from Gentzen natural deduction system from the 1930s,
explained in more modern terms in \cite{girard}. As such, judgments will be
written in the so-called \emph{proof tree form}, such as:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{A}
    \infer1{A \lor B}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
where above the line we have the hypotheses and below the inferences.
In particular, the above rule takes for granted that we have some formulas
$ A $ and $ B $ and it infers that $ A \lor B $ is true given the hypothesis
that $ A $ is true.

Given some $ A $, which can be a set or a proposition, we write $ a \in A $
to mean, using the Curry-Howard correspondence, that either:
\begin{itemize}
\item $ a $ is an element of the set $ A $;
\item $ a $ is a proof of the proposition $ A $.
\end{itemize}

Also, the judgment $ a = b \in A $ means more than meets the eye:
\begin{itemize}
\item $ A $ is a proposition or a set;
\item $ a $ and $ b $ are proofs or elements respectively;
\item $ a $ and $ b $ are identical elements of the set $ A $ or
  represent identical proofs of the proposition $ A $.
\end{itemize}

In fact, more than these readings can be given for the simple judgment
$ a \in A $, as shown in the table of figure \ref{fig:judge}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l | l | l}
    A set & $ a \in A $ & implies \\
    \hline
    $ A $ is a set & $ a $ is an element of the set $ A $ & $ A $ is nonempty \\
    $ A $ is a proposition & $ a $ is a (constructive) proof of  $ A $ & $ A $ is true \\
    $ A $ is an intention (expectation) & $ a $ is a method of fulfilling $ A $ & $ A $ is fulfillable (realizable) \\
    $ A $ is a problem (task) & $ a $ is a method of solving $ A $ & $ A $ is solvable
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Readings of the judgment $ a \in A $, cf.\ \cite[p.\ 4]{mltt}}
  \label{fig:judge}
\end{figure}

In particular, the reading which refers to problem-solving is commonly attributed to
A.\ Kolmogorov (\cite{kolm}) and called the \emph{Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation}.

What is characteristic of MLTT is that in order to ascertain that we have a set
(proposition), we must prescribe an \emph{introduction} rule, by means of showing
how a \emph{canonical} element of the set (proof of the proposition, respectively)
is constructed an \emph{equality} rule which shows how we know that two canonical
elements are equal.

For example, for the set of positive integers (using the Peano approach and denoting
by $ a' $ the successor of the element $ a $), we can give the rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item for the canonical elements: $ 0 \in \NN $ and %
  $ \begin{prooftree} \hypo{a \in \NN} \infer1{a' \in \NN} \end{prooftree} $;
\item equality of canonical elements: $ 0 = 0 \in \NN $ and
  $ \begin{prooftree} \hypo{a = b \in \NN} \infer1{a' = b' \in \NN} \end{prooftree} $.
\end{itemize}

Another example, for the product of two sets (propositions) $ A \times B $, we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item canonical elements:
  \[
    \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{a \in A} \hypo{b \in B} \infer2{(a, b) \in A \times B}
  \end{prooftree};
  \]
\item equality of canonical elements:
  \[
    \begin{prooftree}
      \hypo{a = c \in A} \hypo{b = d \in B}
      \infer2{(a, b) = (c, d) \in A \times B}
    \end{prooftree}
  \]
\end{itemize}

Now, equality of the sets (propositions) as a whole is prescribed by showing
how equal and canonical elements are formed for the sets (propositions).
For example, for sets (propositions), the equality is simply:
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo{a = b \in A}
    \infer1{}
    \infer1{a = b \in B}
  \end{prooftree}.
\]

For non-canonical elements, to explain what it means for them to be elements
of a set (proposition) $ A $, we must specify a method (proof, program) which,
when executed (performed), it yields a \emph{canonical} element of the set as a
result.

Then, finally, two arbitrary (not necessarily canonical) elements of
a set $ A $ are equal if, when executed as above, yield equal
\emph{canonical} elements of the set.

\vspace{0.3cm}

It is now worth focusing our attention on the particular cases of propositions.
Given the setup above, we can write the table in figure \ref{fig:proofs}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    a proof of & consists of \\
    \hline
    $ \perp $ & --- \\
    $ A \land B $ & a proof of $ A $ and a proof of $ B$ \\
    $ A \lor B $ & a proof of $ A $ or a proof of $ B $ \\
    $ A \supset B $ & a method taking any proof of $ A $ into a proof of $ B $ \\
    $ (\forall x) B(x) $ & a method taking any individual $ a $ into a proof of $ B(a) $ \\
    $ (\exists x)B(x) $ & an individual $ a $ and a proof of $ B(a) $
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Proofs of propositions, cf.\ \cite[p.\ 7]{mltt}}
  \label{fig:proofs}
\end{figure}

We can be more precise than that, noting further:
\begin{itemize}
\item the proposition $ \perp $ has no possible proof;
\item $ (a, b) $ is a proof of $ A \land B $, provided that $ a $ is a proof
  of $ A $ and $ b $ is a proof of $ B $;
\item $ i(a) $ or $ j(b) $ are proofs of $ A \lor B $, provided that $ a $
  is a proof of $ A $ and $ b $ is a proof of $ B $, where $ i $ and $ j $
  are the canonical inclusions (which we detail later);
\item $ \lambda x . b(x) $ is a proof of $ A \supset B $, provided that
  $ b(a) $ is a proof of $ B $ under the hypothesis that $ a $ is a proof of $ A $;
\item $ \lambda x . b(x) $ is a proof of $ (\forall x)B(x) $, provided that
  $ b(a) $ is a proof of $ B(a) $, where $ a $ is some individual;
\item $ (a, b) $ is a proof of $ (\exists x)B(x) $, given that $ a $ is an
  individual and $ b $ is a proof of $ B(a) $.
\end{itemize}

Also, the presentation can be extended further to \emph{types}. From a historical,
philosophical and mathematical point of view, types themselves are taken as
primary notions, hence not properly defined. Intuitively though, one can
think of types as \qq{hierarchies}, \qq{levels} of certain kinds of elements
or rather use the computer science intuition of \emph{data types}.

For this case, the judgment \qq{$ a $ is an element of type $ A $} is commonly
denoted by $ a : A $ and if this is the case, we say that the type $ A $ is
\emph{inhabited}.

It can be formally shown that the type-theoretical approach is isomorphic
to the propositional approach and the set-theoretical approach, making what
is commonly known as the \emph{formulas-as-types} or \emph{propositions-as-sets}
interpretations (for intuitionistic logic).
