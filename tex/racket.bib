 abstract = {The view that toposes originated as generalized set theory is a figment of set theoretically educated common sense. This false history obstructs understanding of category theory and especially of categorical foundations for mathematics. Problems in geometry, topology, and related algebra led to categories and toposes. Elementary toposes arose when Lawvere's interest in the foundations of physics and Tierney's in the foundations of topology led both to study Grothendieck's foundations for algebraic geometry. I end with remarks on a categorical view of the history of set theory, including a false history plausible from that point of view that would make it helpful to introduce toposes as a generalization from set theory.},

title={Elimination with a Motive},
booktitle={Types for Proofs and Programs},
year={2002},
publisher={Springer Berlin Heidelberg},

pages={197--216},
abstract={Elimination rules tell us how we may exploit hypotheses in the course of a proof. Many common elimination rules, such as ∨-elim and the induction principles for inductively defined datatypes and relations, are parametric in their conclusion. We typically instantiate this parameter with the goal we are trying to prove, and acquire subproblems specialising this goal to particular circumstances in which the eliminated hypothesis holds. This paper describes a generic tactic, Elim, which supports this ubiquitous idiom in interactive proof and subsumes the functionality of the more specific `induction' and `inversion' tactics found in systems like Coq and Lego[6][7][15]. Elim also supports user-derived rules which follow the same style.},
