#+TITLE: Racket (and) Semantics
#+AUTHOR: Adrian Manea

This is a repository for my learning of the [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]] programming language,
with a strong theoretical motivation and interest. Along the way, I will 
(hopefully) be touching on more related subjects such as Lisps, lambda 
calculus with types, semantics of (mostly) functional programming languages
and more.
