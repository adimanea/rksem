#+TITLE: Dissertation Plan
#+AUTHOR: Adrian Manea

Here I will be outlining the TOC and the basic ideas that will become my
dissertation.

* Introduction and Motivation
- Why I chose the theme;
- What will the work include;
- Current status of the field;
- Future ideas.

* Preliminaries
** Historical aspects
- McCarthy's Lisp mathematical specification and Landin's "mechanizing computation"
as starting points;
	+ Insist on lambda calculus not appropriate for recursive functions (McCarthy);
	+ Ambiguous functions (essential, along with =call/cc=);
- Jump to POPL 2012 and the problems outlined by Findler;

** Scheme crash course
- Basic ideas from SICP;
- R5RS and other specifications;
- =call/cc= discussed separately as a specific item for Scheme;

** Racket
- Basic ideas: What is it, what it offers, why they (PLT) chose it, why I chose it;
- Basic examples and /various/ uses (games, toy languages [typed and untyped], literate
programming [Pollen]);

* PLT Redex
- Brief overview of the literature and available tools (K, OTT);
- What it tries to do (Findler 2012);
- How it does it (describe its syntax and semantics);
	+ Semantics through syntax (see PLT book);
	+ Brief origins (ISWIM and Plotkin);

* Examples
- TBD.

* Conclusions and further work
